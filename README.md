# Lobby Code Hider

This simple mod hides the lobby code for private lobbies. It also adds the ability to show it by pressing a button, as well as copy it to the clipboard on Windows.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this is to use the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/slimemodmanager/releases/latest).


#### Manual Installation
*If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!*
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Then, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/LobbyCodeHider/releases/latest) and place the dll into your plugins folder (`BepInEx/plugins`).

## Usage

No configuration necessary!

Lobby code is hidden by default. On most controllers, press the left bumper to show the lobby code, and the right bumper to copy it to the clipboard.

#### Notes
- Gamecube controllers don't have bumpers, but you can use the triggers instead

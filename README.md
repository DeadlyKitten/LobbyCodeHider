## Installation

The easiest way to install this is to use the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/slimemodmanager/releases/latest).


#### Manual Installation
*If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!*
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Then, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/LobbyCodeHider/releases/latest) and place the dll into your plugins folder (`BepInEx/plugins`).

## Usage

No configuration necessary!

The game now hides lobby codes by default. On most controllers, press the left bumper to copy/paste.

#### Notes
- Gamecube controllers don't have bumpers, but you can use the triggers instead
